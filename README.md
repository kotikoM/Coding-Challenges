# Coding Challenges

Welcome to my coding challenges repository! Here, you'll find solutions to some of the programming puzzles from:

- 🎄 **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)** – Daily holiday-themed coding challenges.
- 🔢 **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress)** – Math-heavy problems designed to test computational thinking.

## 💡 Why This Repo?
This is my personal playground for problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and honing coding skills. Feel free to explore, learn, and discuss solutions!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Primary Language:** Python (just to type less)

Each folder contains individual problem statements and my solutions. Contributions, optimizations, and discussions are always welcome! 🤝
